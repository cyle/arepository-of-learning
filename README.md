# A Repository / of / Learning

## What is this?

Oh jeepers. It's all the source files for http://arepository.com/of/learning/

They're just HTML and CSS... nothing special here. I like hand-coding my HTML. It's not even Markdown.

## What can I do with this?

I dunno. Save a local copy for yourself. Why not. Really this is just for me to keep version control on the files.
